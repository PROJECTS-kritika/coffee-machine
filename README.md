# coffee-machine
I have created this mini project by using OOP and basics python. In this Coffee Machine Project, my task is to implement the logic (starting from a simple class) that translates orders from customers of the coffee machine to the drink maker. My code will use the drink maker protocol to send commands to the drink maker.
